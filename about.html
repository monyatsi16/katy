                <br>
                 <p> Our company was born in the so called Sea-point
                    in the Maseru district, lowlands region, Lesotho.
                     We have grown in this environment and we took an upgrade 
                     to hire a renting house at the middle of the maseru city
                     in order to reach a variety of customers because of the CBD.
                    Highly oriented towards new challenges,Katleho Fashion Design's
                 	 mission is to provide innovative solutions
                    and creativity to help customers to wear with a style.
                    The strong relationship we have with top-tier fashion design
                    companies is testimonial to the high level of skill and
                    quality of services offered to our clients.

                    One of the keys to Katleho Fashion Design success is our

                    and expertise are essential, but not enough if you are not driven

                    keeps us striving for excellence in everything we do.
